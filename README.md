Currently there is a proof of concept implemented in Python (not publically released). This demonstrates a client requesting a webpage from a server, negotiating a price and ultimately receiving the requested webpage. The next iteration will include porting this code to C/C++ or an equivalent compiled language for easy migration to new platforms and extending the functionality.
